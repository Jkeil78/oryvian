* **🤝 Lending & Tracking**: Mark items as lent out, track borrowers, and export lending lists as PDF.
* **🎵 Spotify Integration**: Built-in preview player for audio media directly in the detail view.
* **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile use with quick QR code scanning for inventory lookup.

## Installation with Docker (Recommended)

The application is optimized for operation with Docker Compose.

### 1. Preparation

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
Create a `docker-compose.yml` (or use the provided one) and start the container.

### 2. Configuration (Environment Variables)

Configuration is done via environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` or a `.env` file.

| Variable      | Default           | Description                                             |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `APP_PORT`    | `5000`            | The port on which the web UI is accessible (host port). |
| `UPLOAD_PATH` | `./data/uploads`  | Local path for uploaded images (covers).                |
| `DB_PATH`     | `./data/instance` | Local path for the SQLite database.                     |
| `SECRET_KEY`  | `dev-key...`      | Security key for sessions (should be changed).          |

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    container_name: medienverwaltung
    ports:
      # Format: "HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT"
      # Change the first value to adjust the port (e.g. "8080:5000")
      - "${APP_PORT:-5000}:5000"
    
    volumes:
      # Persistent data storage
      - ${UPLOAD_PATH:-./data/uploads}:/app/static/uploads
      - ${DB_PATH:-./data/instance}:/app/instance
    
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### 3. Start

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application is now available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

## First Login

On first startup, an administrator account is created automatically.

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `admin123`

> **Important:** Please change the password immediately after the first login under “Profile”.

## Setting Up External Services

To use all features, API keys should be stored in **Settings**:

1. **Discogs (for music metadata):**

   * Create an account on Discogs.
   * Generate a “Personal Access Token” under Developer Settings.
   * Enter it in the settings.

2. **Spotify (for player integration):**

   * Create an app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
   * Copy “Client ID” and “Client Secret”.
   * Enter them in the settings.

## Backup

In the admin area, you can download a complete backup at any time. It includes the SQLite database as well as all images. To restore, simply upload the ZIP file again.
